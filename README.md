## On the existence of superradiant excitonic states in microtubules

**Authors:** P. Kurian, G. Dunston, J. Lindesay

**Summary:** Proposes that microtubules support superradiant excitonic states through networks of tryptophan molecules. Using 3D structures of tubulin, the authors demonstrate that >10,400 tryptophan molecules in 800nm MT segments form a quantum network with strong supertransfer coupling (150-200 cm⁻¹), enabling ballistic excitation spreading and coherent energy transfer along MT lattices.

## Ultraviolet superradiance from mega-networks of tryptophan in biological architectures

**Authors:** B. Yalcin, S. Haas, P. Kurian

**Summary:** Experimentally validates UV superradiance in biological mega-networks (>10⁵ chromophores) by measuring fluorescence quantum yields across hierarchical tubulin structures. Shows QY increases from Trp (12.4%) → tubulin (10.6%) → MTs (17.6%), with thermal robustness up to 1000 cm⁻¹ disorder. Demonstrates cooperative robustness in centrioles (112,320 Trps) and neuronal bundles, suggesting biological systems exploit quantum coherence for efficient energy transfer.

## eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels

**Authors:** Alexander DeRieux, Walid Saad

**Summary:** First QMARL framework to exploit quantum entanglement for agent cooperation without sharing local observations. Uses a quantum entangled split critic with joint measurements over quantum channels to enable implicit coordination. Achieves 17.8% faster convergence with 25× fewer centralized parameters compared to classical baselines. Demonstrates that Ψ+ entanglement enables effective cooperation across MDP and POMDP environments.

**arXiv:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15237 (inferred from ICLR 2025 publication)
